The other big project I worked on at WayForward. I worked on the launch Apple Arcade™️ release of this game. This was made in WayForward's proprietary C++ engine. 
Work on this game included working with designers to implement their level design into the game. In particular, I helped setup the various environmental hazards 
and ensuring they functions with the right behavior and SFX/VFX.

I also helped with other small systems as needed. A few examples include the credits for the game and implementing achievements.
