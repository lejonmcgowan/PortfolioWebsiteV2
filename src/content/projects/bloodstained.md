I worked on Bloodstained in the capacity of a gameplay programmer. Pretty exciting first project to have out of college. 

I worked on various features as needed which mostly includeed bug fixes in the systems, minimaps, and character controller. My big responsibility of this included 
the implementation of force feedback (vibration) to the game, which included the Nintendo Switch's HD Rumble™. The latter was particularly exciting to worke with 
as it let me collboarate with the sound team in order to make some particularly satisfying feelings as you play through the game. 

Working in this game involved heavy navigation of both C++ and Blueprints.
