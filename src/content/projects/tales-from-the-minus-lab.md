Embark on a journey through the worlds hidden within a single room in Tales from the Minus Lab. Shrink down to the size of an ant and grow back to human size freely as you chart a course through the hazardous waters of a baking soda volcano and scale the windy heights of an air conditioning duct.

Upcoming project I'm providing tech for. Looking forwards to talking more about this game one day! As of now, I can say I'm working with the director to architect the core systems and pipelines the game will need for a smooth development.
