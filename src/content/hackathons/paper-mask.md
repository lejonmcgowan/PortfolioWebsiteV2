## Overview

![Global Game Jam 2026](../../assets/papermask/TitleScreenShot.png)

A recent game made with a team of 3: 2 programmers, 1 artist. It's a 2.5D adventure title made in the style of Paper Mario.  

Work was roughly evenly divided between the two programmers. I worked on integrating the sound systems and balancing, implementing the animation (which included creating the paper flip action in the animation system when the characer turned), input processing, and character controller.
